karasu
======

karasu is a self-hosted remote communication system designed for math
discussions. karasu is expected to be accompanied by kamome [1], the
front-end components, i.e. the editor and styleÂ­sheets for karasu.

See

    https://krasjet.com/voice/karasu/

for a detailed introduction.

Install
-------

Docker compose should be able to take care of everything.

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Krasjet/karasu.git
    $ cd karasu
    $ cp .env.example .env
    $ docker-compose up

Note that the default fonts in kamome is a set of alternative free fonts. If
you want to use the ones I'm currently using, you need to purchase/download the
fonts listed here [2] and set the `USE_ALT_FONTS` option in docker-compose.yml
to `false`.

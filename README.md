Install
-------

Docker compose should be able to take care of everything.

```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Krasjet/karasu.git
$ cd karasu
$ cp .env.example .env
$ docker-compose up
```

Note that the default fonts in [kamome][kamome] is a set of alternative free
fonts. If you want to use the ones I'm currently using, you need to
purchase/download the fonts listed [here][fonts] and set the `USE_ALT_FONTS`
option in `docker-compose.yml` to `false`.
